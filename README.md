## I make things go fast with AWS Serverless

### Turning an unhealthy amount of coffee into outcomes by <b>delivering value beyond code</b>. 
I am an AWS Community Hero and Founder of [WarpURL](https://warpurl.com) which I am building in public.

Iâ€™m a passionate multilingual developer/architect focusing on AWS, Serverless and all that AWS has to offer.

I organize the AWS PTA Meetup and do the occasional presentation as well. I am an avid blogger, helping the AWS community where possible, always lurking in all the #aws slack channels and answering questions.

I have a strong background in Electronic and Electronic Communications Engineering, but my focus has since shifted to focus on everything AWS.

My favorite languages include JS, TS, Golang and PHP, but I am multilingual and have touched on many industries and technologies.

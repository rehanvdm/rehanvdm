# 👋 I'm Rehan!

## I make things go fast with AWS & Serverless

### Fueled by coffee, delivering value beyond code. 

I am an [AWS Community Hero](https://builder.aws.com/community/heroes) and just [a guy who is a developer for fun](https://rehanvdm.com/just-a-guy).

I'm a passionate developer and architect specializing in AWS and serverless technologies. With a focus on performance optimization and scalable solutions, I help teams build fast, reliable, and cost-effective cloud applications.

As an AWS Community Hero, I'm dedicated to sharing knowledge and helping others succeed in their cloud journey. Whether it's through blog posts, open-source contributions, or community engagement, I believe in the power of collaboration and continuous learning.

When I'm not architecting cloud solutions or writing code, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, enjoying a good cup of coffee, pizza or playing video games.
